# A multi-step block form built in React with global state, persisted data, routing, validation, and error messages


##Packages used: 

-REACT-HOOK-FORM: A form library that helps make complex forms a little less.. complex. It has tons of functionality within the api. Everything from front-end validation to error handling is hook functionality. It works extremely well with the packages listed below. If you haven't checked it out yet definitely take a look. https://react-hook-form.com/

-YUP:  A schema builder that can transform, match, shape, and validate values. It makes it really easy to add constraints to input values and has handy methods to pass data, help with error messaging & tons more capabilities!

-LITTLE-STATE-MACHINE: An awesome state management library that offers persisted state! Super simple to use and set up. Same as redux without the boilerplate!
